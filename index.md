Our project named **MIA_Visual (Model Intuitive Evaluation_Visualization)** is an open-source project to help select models of machine learning.  
1.'Learning curve analysis visualization', helps to determine the reliability of the model.  

2.'Weight update process visualization' helps intuitively determine how weights are gradually updated.  

3.through 'Visualization of classification model performance evaluation indicators', it helps to intuitively understand each evaluation indicator and set an appropriate threshold.  
_**The above three functions help select a more performance model.**_
